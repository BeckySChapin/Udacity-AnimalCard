# Udacity-AnimalCard
My Animal Card project for the Udacity &amp; #GrowWithGoogle program (Lesson 8)

This project is intended to flex our HTML/CSS skills while also being able to replicate a mock-up as close to pixel perfect as possible. I know that this version is not currently responsive, but I plan on creating a second version that has both my own styling added to it (rather than just that of the mock-up) and is more responsive and versatile.
